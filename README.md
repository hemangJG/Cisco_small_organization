üè¢ Small Organization Network Setup - Cisco Packet Tracer
This repository contains the configuration and documentation for a multi-subnet corporate network simulation built in Cisco Packet Tracer.

üéØ Goal
To design, configure, and verify connectivity across four distinct local area networks (LANs) using a central router for inter-network communication, and to deploy basic DNS and Web (HTTP) services on a central server.

üíª Network Topology Overview
The network is divided into four main sections, each representing a department with its own Layer 3 network segment. A single router acts as the gateway for all internal traffic.

Section / Department	Network Address	Default Gateway (Router Interface)	Key Devices
Database/Server	192.168.1.0/24	192.168.1.1 (Fa1/0)	1 Server
Administration	192.168.2.0/24	192.168.2.1 (Fa0/0)	2 PCs
Accounts & Finance	192.168.3.0/24	192.168.3.1 (Fa0/1)	2 PCs
Information Technology (IT)	192.168.4.0/24	192.168.4.1 (Fa1/1)	2 PCs

(Note: Router interface names may vary, e.g., Fa4/0, Gig0/0/0, depending on the model/modules used in Packet Tracer.)

üõ†Ô∏è Hardware & Components
Device	Quantity	Model (Recommended)
Router	1	PT-Router or Cisco 2911 (with FastEthernet modules)
Switch	4	Switch-PT (Generic) or Cisco 2960
Server	1	Server-PT

‚öôÔ∏è Key Configuration Details
1. End Device IP Assignment
All PCs and the Server use static IP addresses. The DNS Server address for all devices is the Server's IP address (192.168.1.100).

Component	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Default Gateway	DNS Server
Server0	192.168.1.100	255.255.255.0	192.168.1.1	192.168.1.100
PC0 (Admin)	192.168.2.3	255.255.255.0	192.168.2.1	192.168.1.100
PC2 (Accounts)	192.168.3.3	255.255.255.0	192.168.3.1	192.168.1.100
PC4 (IT)	192.168.4.3	255.255.255.0	192.168.4.1	192.168.1.100

2. Router Configuration
The following IP addresses are configured on the router's physical interfaces and enabled using the no shutdown command.

Router Interface	IP Address	Subnet Mask
Fa1/0 (or corresponding port)	192.168.1.1	255.255.255.0
Fa0/0 (or corresponding port)	192.168.2.1	255.255.255.0
Fa0/1 (or corresponding port)	192.168.3.1	255.255.255.0
Fa1/1 (or corresponding port)	192.168.4.1	255.255.255.0

3. Server Service Configuration
The following services are enabled on Server0 (192.168.1.100):

Service	Setting
DNS	ON
DNS Entry	Name: www.google.com (or similar) maps to IP: 192.168.1.100
HTTP/HTTPS	ON

‚úÖ Verification
Inter-Network Ping Test: Successful ping from any PC (e.g., PC0) to a device in a different network (e.g., PC2 or Server0) confirms successful static routing through the router.

Web Connectivity Test: Opening the web browser on any PC and navigating to the configured DNS name (www.google.com) confirms that both DNS resolution and HTTP services are correctly configured and accessible across subnets.
